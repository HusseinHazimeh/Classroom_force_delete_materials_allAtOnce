# Classroom_force_delete_materials_allAtOnce
Google Classroom is an e-learning platform that has been emerged recently in many schools and universities in the world. This platform is free and easy-to-use. However, it has a number of limitations in many features. One of these features is the ability of deleting multiple or all classroom materials at once. 

Currently, if you want to delete all materials in your classroom, you are required to delete them one by one, which is very time consuming and needs a lot of effort. 
This code allows you to customize this feature and delete all classroom materials at once, using Selenium and Xpath technologies. 

To configure the code, follow these steps:

(1) download the Selenium web driver from this page: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
(2) put the downloaded driver in the desktop, or any preferred location.
(3) create a new java project under exlipse framework.
(4) configure the parameters inside your code (all the parameters are commented).
(5) run the code 
(6) note: do not perform any action or clicking anywhere during the run time, because this code acts as a robot.
